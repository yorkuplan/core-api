This course is designed to look directly at those issues. Specifically, this course provides an introduction to the Canadian legal profession, professional rules, norms and values, regulatory institutions and processes, and the practical ethical issues that lawyers face. It focuses on the context of the Canadian lawyer's many and varied roles: as advocate, advisor, employee, employer, entrepreneur or public servant. It considers the various contexts in which lawyers work: in solo practice, firm practice, government practice or in-house. It also examines lawyers as members of a profession with collective responsibilities in relation to the public interest and access to justice. The course situates these issues within their modern-day context; that is, within a context characterized by local diverse communities, normative pluralism, globalization and transnationalism. This course is taught in an interactive online format, with regular instructor and classmate interaction. In each section of the course, students will do independent reading, review multimedia content in the course website, and communicate with their instructor(s) and fellow students.

      "description": "This course covers the core concepts in two foundational areas of the Canadian common law -- contract and tort -- by combining that material into one course. There are two overarching bases for the decision to combine contract and torts into one course. First, there is a natural overlap between these two substantive areas of law and as such there is a strong pedagogical reason for the study of these two areas in one course. Second, candidates for the LL.M. program will benefit from the additional opportunity provided to them to take one further subject course instead of taking two separate courses. From a pedagogical standpoint, there is merit to this combination of courses as it affords occasion to talk about the shape and inter-relationship of the common law categories. As this course is envisioned as an introduction, there is an effort to guide candidates through these legal disciplines in a manner that speaks to the distinct features as well as the overlapping points of each. The introduction to the course illustrates to candidates a common origin for contract and torts; thereby underlining the basis of the combination. Beginning with the discussion of remedies, the contemporary connection between contract and torts will be explored in more detail. Finally, candidates are taken through the business/economic scenarios in which contract and torts overlap."

To what extent do television products promote resistance and change and to what extent do they preserve the status quo? Students will apply several frameworks to selected products in order to analyse how the product works in relation to individuals and communities.\r\nSame as Ryerson Graduate Communication & Culture 925."

      "description": "The themes of language, culture and teaching are central to the Graduate Program in Education at York University. The centrality of these themes is articulated in both the PhD proposal as well as the OCGS report for the Masters program. This Masters level course explores the central themes of the program in relation to: (a) social historical and cultural contexts of education, (b) contemporary practices of pedagogy, learning and curriculum, and (c) research methodologies. This course has several unique features. First of all, this course offers students the opportunity to consider questions of language, culture and teaching in a sustained manner across a year of study. It is the only full-course offering in the Masters program in Education. Secondly, the course is offered during the day as an implicit means of creating a central site of intellectual engagement for full time students. In other words, the course operates to create an academic community among full time students. Thirdly, typically, the course is staffed by two faculty members of differing backgrounds (e.g., a sociologist and a literacy educator). this staffing permits students to see the way  in which different approaches to questions of language, culture and teaching can lead to complementary or contradictory insights in to this area of study."

      "description": "The term, multilingual education, typically refers to the teaching of and through more than two languages. This means that multilingual education is concerned with language policy. Language choices and uses in education reflect social policy decisions within a multicultural or cross-cultural context. In this course, we investigate language policy, education, ecology, and hegemony in our changing world. Multilingual education will be viewed in multiple ways, incorporating internal and international responses to globalization and multiculturalism. In our world today, people live in increasingly multicultural, multilingual countries where historical concepts of belonging are under pressure to respond to current cultural realities. Technological advances of the late twentieth century have simultaneaously provided people with the means to move around the globe much more easily and drawn edges of the world closer within virtual space, such that cross-glabal communications take place in nanoseconds. This has changed language use enormously in terms of both which languages we use most often and the media through which we communicate using these languages."

      "description": "Urban communities are typically spatial centres to which individuals migrate and immigrate. With this comes increased population density, economic disparities and increased cultural, ethic, racial and religious diversity. Public institutions, and schools in particular, are charged with the responsibility of addressing the resultant challenges. Using Toronto as an example, the course begins by examining the question: What characterizes urban schools We then go on to examine the historical, social, economis and political issues in the city and investigate how the demographic changes in particular have affected the education system. What changes have occured in the teaching, professional and administrative staff of the schools in term of representation What curricula, programmatic and pedagogical changes have occured? What are the challenges and tensions that the schools face as they attempt to accomodate diverse cultures? Schools in Toronto will be investigated and used as case studies. Through urban theory, field visits and individual assignments we will investigate the extent to which schools' currucula, program and staff representatives are responsive to the needs of today's students. Special attention will be paid to the roles of educators, students and parents in helping address educational, cultural and social issues. The goal of this course, therefore, is to enable students to develop working (tentative and transitional) conceptualizations around the following essential question: how are power, knowledge, identity and cultural representation organized within the space of urban educational encounters?"

Students will experience how expanded understandings of cultural translation and textuality have radically altered and expanded the Eurocentric character of the discipline.\r\n\r\nQuestions for investigation includes: How have the aesthetics and politics of Comparative Literature changed over the past two hundred years? What factors have influenced those changes? How is World Literature related to Comparative Literature? How do both relate to colonial, post-colonial, diasporic, cultural and translation studies and digital humanities?"

Students taking the course as part of the GDiP in Creative Writing will be evaluated primarily on their poetry; other students will be evaluated on the basis of their academic work."

Managers are literally bombarded with data (the information overload problem) and must be able to filter and assess the quality of such data before inputting into managerial decision models. The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question. Managers read and possibly rely on many research reports over their careers and it is important to be able to distinguish good research from weak research."

      "description": "This course is divided into two sections, Part I (Legal Research) and Part II (Legal Writing).\n\nPart I (Legal Research) - Description Part I of this course teaches students the basic techniques of legal research relevant to Canadian Law, which is essential for legal studies and is a fundamental tool of the lawyering profession in Canada. In this course, students will learn the different categories of legal information and how they are published, organized, and indexed. In addition to learning traditional research methods, students will also be trained to use computer-assisted legal research, including major legal databases such as LexisNexis/Quicklaw, Westlaw Canada, and CCH Online. The purpose of Part I of this course is also to provide international graduate students with the essential skills to identify, locate, and understand legal materials relevant to business scenarios around the world. Therefore, not only Canadian, but also the US, foreign, and international legal research resources will be reviewed. \n\nPart II (Legal Writing) - Description Fundamentally, the materials, classes and evaluation methods for Part II of the course are designed to: (1) assist students to use the legal research skills acquired in Part I to create legal documents; (2) assist students to acquire the tools required to perform sound legal writing; (3) assist students to develop ways to analyze legal problems that will be applied both during and after the IBL program; and (4) assist students to use provided frameworks to create a range of commonly used legal documents within the Canadian legal system. During Part II of the course, students will have the opportunity to complete a number of assignments which progressively build upon analytical and writing skills. The primarily assignment-based nature of this part of the course requires a significant and &quot;steady&quot; time commitment"

Therefore, not only Canadian, but also the US, foreign, and international legal research resources will be reviewed. \n\nPart II (Legal Writing) - Description Fundamentally, the materials, classes and evaluation methods for Part II of the course are designed to: (1) assist students to use the legal research skills acquired in Part I to create legal documents; (2) assist students to acquire the tools required to perform sound legal writing; (3) assist students to develop ways to analyze legal problems that will be applied both during and after the IBL program; and (4) assist students to use provided frameworks to create a range of commonly used legal documents within the Canadian legal system. During Part II of the course, students will have the opportunity to complete a number of assignments which progressively build upon analytical and writing skills. The primarily assignment-based nature of this part of the course requires a significant and &quot;steady&quot; time commitment"

Beginning with a critical examination of the historiography of North American immigrant and ethnic studies, it assesses the immigrant experience through a variety of themes. The social dimensions are explored through such topics as the causes and strategies of migration, social segregation and stratification, race and gender. The cultural aspects deal with questions of identity, cultural retention and accommodation, xenophobia, multiculturalism, and multiracialism. Attention will also be given to immigration and refugee policies, responses to such policies, as well as their effectiveness in regulating the economic, social, and cultural life of North America."

      "description": "Urban communities are typically spatial centres to which individuals migrate and immigrate. With this comes increased population density, economic disparities and increased cultural, ethic, racial and religious diversity. Public institutions, and schools in particular, are charged with the responsibility of addressing the resultant challenges. Using Toronto as an example, the course begins by examining the question: What characterizes urban schools We then go on to examine the historical, social, economis and political issues in the city and investigate how the demographic changes in particular have affected the education system. What changes have occured in the teaching, professional and administrative staff of the schools in term of representation What curricula, programmatic and pedagogical changes have occured? What are the challenges and tensions that the schools face as they attempt to accomodate diverse cultures? Schools in Toronto will be investigated and used as case studies. Through urban theory, field visits and individual assignments we will investigate the extent to which schools' currucula, program and staff representatives are responsive to the needs of today's students. Special attention will be paid to the roles of educators, students and parents in helping address educational, cultural and social issues. The goal of this course, therefore, is to enable students to develop working (tentative and transitional) conceptualizations around the following essential question: how are power, knowledge, identity and cultural representation organized within the space of urban educational encounters?"

      "description": "The term, multilingual education, typically refers to the teaching of and through more than two languages. This means that multilingual education is concerned with language policy. Language choices and uses in education reflect social policy decisions within a multicultural or cross-cultural context. In this course, we investigate language policy, education, ecology, and hegemony in our changing world. Multilingual education will be viewed in multiple ways, incorporating internal and international responses to globalization and multiculturalism. In our world today, people live in increasingly multicultural, multilingual countries where historical concepts of belonging are under pressure to respond to current cultural realities. Technological advances of the late twentieth century have simultaneaously provided people with the means to move around the globe much more easily and drawn edges of the world closer within virtual space, such that cross-glabal communications take place in nanoseconds. This has changed language use enormously in terms of both which languages we use most often and the media through which we communicate using these languages."

Under the ambit of this topic would fall critical, feminist, postcolonial, and third world approaches to international law, law and development, legal and political theory, international economic law, as well as a range of interdisciplinary scholarship on globalization.  Issues that may be taken up for discussion include the rule of law and the place of the exception, legal imperialism, the laws of war, global legal pluralism, transnational constitutionalism, the changing role of states and civil society in transnational governance, trade and development, and human rights.  The reading group is envisioned as an engaged and collaborative undertaking.  While the convener will propose a range of options for weekly topics and readings, participants will have the opportunity to participate in determining the specifics of the list over the course of the year."

The goal of the Study Group will not be to inculcate any particular approach or set of answers. Instead, it will canvass a range of topics and materials so as to enable students to receive a broad sense of the contemporary challenges to be met and pitfalls to be avoided in addressing this question. The readings will comprise an eclectic mix of interdisciplinary material, drawing from political economy, philosophy, literature, economics, social theory, and, of course, law and jurisprudence."

Instead, for these purposes, state law will be treated as one amongst many competing normative systems, and not necessarily the most dominant.   In addition to conventional legal-theoretical writing, group members may introduce work from the other social sciences, novels, serious journalism etc.   Law will also be placed in its historical context, with resources drawn from legal history.  Group members will be invited to speak to the readings from the perspective of whatever field of law is of particular interest to them - international, labour, criminal, corporate, family - and to reflect on the practical as well as the theoretical implications of these readings."

The course will then focus on visualisation tools and exploratory data analysis, high dimensional statistical tools such as LASSO and tensor analysis, as well as causality and propensity scores. The students will learn how these tools are implemented on large data sets through case studies."

      "description": "This course covers the fundamentals of control system design and analysis using statespace methods. It includes both the practical and theoretical aspects of the topic. The students will learn the way to design controllers using state-space methods and evaluate the control performance and validate if these controllers are robust to system uncertainties and external disturbances. Knowledge of linear algebra, differential equations (including Laplace Transforms) and complex numbers is essential for this course. Same as GS Mathematics & Statistics 6655 3.0/Integrated with Lassone Engineering 4650 3.0."

Lack of access to comprehensive on-line service is a component of data security, yet monitoring on-line behaviour can have a significant impact on privacy. At the same time, governments or government-sponsored actors often have legitimate reasons for such activities, for example, to reduce the incidence of crime or terrorism. The course considers these activities and their competing agendas. Key topics include some technological aspects of censorship, surveillance and anti-circumvention, attribution of unwanted acts, and justifications for blocking and monitoring."

Directed reading courses are intended to enable students to pursue a research interest not covered by any of the seminar courses offered in that year; to enable them to explore an unfamiliar topic with a view to making it the topic of the thesis or dissertation; or to fill a gap in their knowledge which might impede their special research. M.A. students may not substitute more than one, or Ph.D. students more than two directed readings for regular seminar courses. Directed reading courses are given ex gratia by members of the faculty and the approval of the Program Director must be obtained in advance. This will not normally be given unless the Director is satisfied that the student has the appropriate background to pursue the course at a suitably advanced level."

The course first examines theoretical and historical perspectives, including the formation of welfare states and their subsequent crisis and restructuring.  The second section focuses on neo-liberalism and how it has altered the nature of social provisioning.  The third section examines the period since the 2008 financial crisis, the growing use of debt as a form of social provisioning, and the implications of on-going austerity measures. A theme running throughout the course is how hierarchies of gender, race/ethnicity and class have formed part of the transformations that have taken place and created differential impacts."

Major theoretical contributions and debates discussed include issues\nthat dominated the field during the 1970's (women in the ethnographic literature; the\npublic/private dichotomy; male dominance; impact of colonialism) as well as current concerns\nregarding feminist methodology, cultural constructions of gender and the female body, and\nwomen's resistance.\n(Same as Women's Studies 6301.03.)\nProfessor Romalis"
