Cities are conceptualized as embedded in nature and in turn shaping nature in myriad ways. Lectures, field trips, readings and discussion provide the framework for the understanding of natural processes and their interaction with cultural practices and social-political structures in the urban landscape. Different urban environments and design projects provide a framework of systemic inquiry, criticism and interpretation.\r\nPrerequisite:  Second year standing or by permission of the course director."
