Novels, films, exhibitions, photography, and memorials are among the types of representations that may be examined in the course. The course considers how cultural representations of pedagogy affect contemporary ideas about teaching and learning. Social institutions and popular culture have the capacity to create, not just reflect, knowledge. A central assumption of the course is that cultural representations impact the ways that educators understand themselves and their work. The course raises questions about the significance of cultural depictions, their historical and social formation, and their value for theorizing multiple learning environments."

It examines the ways in which governments create educational policy and the influence that non-government organizations, such as cultural advocates, business and labour associations, parent groups, and social movements have in the world of schooling, college and universities. It studies the influence of those who lack direct authority over educational institutions but who may well influence the agendas and policy choices of governments, school boards, post-secondary educational decision-making bodies. Specifically, it looks at parent councils, lobby groups, teacher unions, business representatives, and Aboriginal associations. By way of illustration, it explores the topics of special education and the politics of race and schooling and it assesses the role of the media in shaping educational perspectives. Finally, it looks at policy-making in post-secondary education as well as the relationships between institutions (i.e. colleges, universities) and the communities in which they are located. The course should be of interest to those seeking to understand the process of educational change, the ways in which the educational community, writ large, contributes to such change, and the role of education in modern society.

      "description": "This is a research course where students conduct a small-scale study in which they explore how community organizations carry out their educational functions in increasingly changing, culturally diverse, inequitable contexts. The course begins by introducing students to a broad discussion of community and how ideas of community can inform the work of community organizations. It then builds on multiple understandings of community as theory, as place, as method, as identity, as ideology, as policy and practice to review and rethink the work of community organizations as community resources providing education for the learning needs, interests and aspirations of community members. The place of community organizations as constituents of change is examined and, in reference to their own research study, students are introduced to how community is taken up in respective disciplines e.g. psychology (Smail, 2001), critical psychology (Prilleltensky & Nelson, 2002), sociology, education, social work as suggestive interpretive frames for investigating and reading experiences of community and agency.

      "description": "This is a research course where students conduct a small-scale study in which they explore how community organizations carry out their educational functions in increasingly changing, culturally diverse, inequitable contexts. The course begins by introducing students to a broad discussion of community and how ideas of community can inform the work of community organizations. It then builds on multiple understandings of community as theory, as place, as method, as identity, as ideology, as policy and practice to review and rethink the work of community organizations as community resources providing education for the learning needs, interests and aspirations of community members. The place of community organizations as constituents of change is examined and, in reference to their own research study, students are introduced to how community is taken up in respective disciplines e.g. psychology (Smail, 2001), critical psychology (Prilleltensky & Nelson, 2002), sociology, education, social work as suggestive interpretive frames for investigating and reading experiences of community and agency.

It examines relationships between policies and how the same policy leads to varied (and often unequal) effects for different groups. Finally, the course highlights how individuals and groups can influence policy processes. Prerequisites ED/EDST 1000 3.0; ED/EDST 1100 3.0; ED/EDST 1200 3.0; Course exclusion HUMA 3694 3.0"

Reworking sample mathematics with these supports, including manipulatives (as described in the Ontario Curriculum) and appropriate technology (dynamic geometry, as identified in the Ontario Curriculum)\nprovides opportunities for future teachers to develop their mathematical repertoire and confidence, as well as their capacity to offer active engagement with multiple approaches that can support the diversity of student thinking found in problem solving situations. The activities selected, and the associated group projects, will also cross-curricular boundaries and cultural boundaries to connect mathematics and spatial reasoning to real world experiences. These activities and reflections will also connect to learning objectives and concepts from science, social sciences such as geography, and visual arts, supporting a broad range of connected student learning in the STEM and STEAM disciplines, and beyond. A key component will be building and exploring embodied approaches, including spatial reasoning, kinesthetic and spatial-visual representations to support learning and thinking for children and in the elementary classrooms. These approaches are also central in the practices of mathematics, the sciences and many of the arts, at all levels and across most cultures.

There will be an emphasis on how theoretical understandings must underpin notions of pedagogy and classroom practice, and how practice can be interrogated in light of these theoretical frameworks. The expectation is that effective practitioners have a strong sense of what they know and how they know it, and what they are doing and why they are doing it. The general approach of the course will be exploratory rather than didactic. At all levels, learning can be thought of as research: an active construction of personal knowledge, based on formulating and testing hypotheses and, in light of an evaluation of the results, modifying one's beliefs and practices. In this spirit, we shall attempt to make connections between the reading, writing and discussion that take place in the course, and the reading, writing and discussion of the classroom setting. Class sessions will vary in format and will include discussions of the readings which are set for each week, lectures, guest presentations and work on individual and group projects.\nNOTE: Courses in this program are part of a professional post-graduate diploma program, and are not open for registration to students outside the program. Courses are not open for auditing. Only available to students in the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Teacher Education program."

      "description": "The central purposes of this course are to develop an understanding of reading and writing processes in learners with hearing loss, and to develop knowledge about the pedagogical practices and assessment/evaluation strategies that support text-based literacy development in this population. There will be an emphasis on how theoretical understandings underpin notions of pedagogy and classroom practice, and how practice can be interrogated in light of these theoretical frameworks. The expectation is that effective practitioners have a strong sense of what they know and how they know it, and what they are doing and why they are doing it.  This course will provide teacher candidates with the skills and knowledge needed to provide assessment and instruction in the development of spoken language through listening, to learners who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing from preschool to school age. Information about typical child development and the impact of hearing loss on child development and school achievement will be presented. Assessment and instruction techniques will be presented and then applied during the practicum and case studies.\r\nNOTE: Courses in this program are part of a professional post-graduate diploma program, and are not open for registration to students outside the program. Courses are not open for auditing."

The course content will expand student's understanding of a professional studio practice, encompassing collaborative professional development with other disciplines (science, technology, engineering etc), artist driven curatorial projects, collaborative community based projects, and examining the possibilities for traditional research based practices (working with archives, educational institutions, etc.). Lectures, guest speakers, and field trips address a variety of topics such as an evaluation of graduate programs, grant writing, contracts, copyright / intellectual property, exhibition proposals, research practices and skills, networking, social media promotion, documentation archive, marketing and business development. \r\n Students evolve individual plans for transitioning from undergraduate study to post graduate study or work by researching and analyzing the requirements and limitations of opportunities relevant to their current practice and future goals."
