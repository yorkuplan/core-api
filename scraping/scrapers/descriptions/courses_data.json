This course challenges you to engage with other ways of knowing and being, and to rethink your taken-for-granted knowledge and beliefs through the comparative analysis of the human condition. This course will take a problem-based approach to a range of topics such as: the effects of race and racism, sources of religious conflict, alternate genders and sexualities, First Nations and health, international development and issues of social inequality. Students are encouraged to bring their own knowledge and experience as the first step in \"thinking like an anthropologist\" (i.e. rethinking the taken-for-granted).

To support this topical breadth this course draws readings from a variety of disciplines that include art history, cinema and media studies, game studies, anthropology, and environmental criticism.

The course begins by theoretically interrogating the notions of medium, media, and new media, looking to key figures such as Walter Benjamin, Marshall McLuhan, and Clement Greenberg, before taking a thematic rather than strictly chronological tour through new media art history. Classes consist of a blend of slide lectures, video screenings, student presentations, and group discussion. Classes are organized thematically with weekly topics that will include combinations of the following topics: print, performance, photography, television, cinema, video, animation, systems, networks, surveillance, the body, games and play, social media, virtual worlds, simulation, ecologies, digital decay, and the postdigital. To support this topical breadth this course draws readings from a variety of disciplines that include art history, cinema and media studies, game studies, anthropology, and environmental criticism. By the end of this course students will have gained a broad understanding of the many fluid theoretical relationships between contemporary art and technology, as well as a more specific historical knowledge of key figures and objects with the new media art canon.

Programming of the Study Centre affords creative curatorial opportunities with students developing and realizing a class exhibition project that may be both physical (inside the study centre) and online. From first inception to realization, this exhibition project will teach art handling, project management, database maintenance, budgeting, and communication skills, alongside marketing and public outreach planning, grant writing and donation fair market appraisals. Key museological and curatorial practice readings will accompany hands-on practice. Guest leaders in museum management and off-site visits will also be scheduled.

Students learn about the various ways in which an agent can exploit physical energies such as light, sound, and chemical signals to serve their species-specific needs. Adopting a comparative approach, the course focuses on highly specialized sensory systems and unusual, often surprising solutions to sensory challenges. Sensory systems are explored with respect to the function, the principles of the underlying information processing, and their physiological implementation in the organism. To understand the value of specialized sensory systems, the course also discusses the context in which sensory systems are used, and the constraints that may limit their evolution. Technical solutions to sensory problems in robotics are discussed and compared to those invented by natural evolution. Theories covered include Bayesian Inference, Ideal Observer Theory, and Control Theory. Discussion of original literature and examples that showcase the reality of empirical science are used whenever appropriate.

    "description": "This course covers the core concepts in two foundational areas of the Canadian common law -- contract and tort -- by combining that material into one course. There are two overarching bases for the decision to combine contract and torts into one course. First, there is a natural overlap between these two substantive areas of law and as such there is a strong pedagogical reason for the study of these two areas in one course. Second, candidates for the LL.M. program will benefit from the additional opportunity provided to them to take one further subject course instead of taking two separate courses. From a pedagogical standpoint, there is merit to this combination of courses as it affords occasion to talk about the shape and inter-relationship of the common law categories. As this course is envisioned as an introduction, there is an effort to guide candidates through these legal disciplines in a manner that speaks to the distinct features as well as the overlapping points of each. The introduction to the course illustrates to candidates a common origin for contract and torts; thereby underlining the basis of the combination. Beginning with the discussion of remedies, the contemporary connection between contract and torts will be explored in more detail. Finally, candidates are taken through the business/economic scenarios in which contract and torts overlap.",

    "description": "Behavioural ecology focuses on the behavioural interactions among individuals at both the intraspecific level in natural populations and the interspecific level in natural communities. Behavioural ecology asks questions about proximate and ultimate causes of behaviour, the development of behaviour, the flexibility of behaviour and learning, the adaptive value of behaviour for survival and reproduction, and the phylogenetic relationships among diverse behavioural patterns. In an overarching sense, it considers behavioural interactions against the metric of evolutionary fitness. A common focus of behavioural ecologists' research is to consider how efficiently animals use their time and energy in obtaining mates and resources against measures of survival and reproductive success, including analyses of the trade-offs associated with optimizing the use of time and energy. This course explores the many behavioural contexts that are manifest in natural populations of animals. Major themes include (a) behaviours under competition, including evolutionary stable strategies, frequency dependence,and the application of game theory; (b) behavioural plasticity; (c) changing behaviours in environments of changing or complex selective pressures; (d) territorial behaviour and economic defendability; (e) sex-specific patterns of behaviour in the mating realm, including the operation of sexual selection, the phylogeny of mating systems, the mediation of challenges based in sexual conflict, and behaviourally flexible alternative mating strategies; (f) patterns of behaviour related to parenting, including mother-father conflict, parent offspring conflict, and sibling conflict; (g) both antagonistic and cooperative social behaviours, including alloparenting and the special case of social insects;and (h) communication and signaling behaviours in diverse sensory realms.

    "description": "This course explores the evolution, ecology, physiology and human impact of the ubiquitous yet enigmatic group of organisms classified as fungi. Lectures examine the diversity, phylogeny and taxonomy of major groups of fungi and fungus-like organisms; the unique cell and reproductive biology of fungi; basic features of fungal primary and secondary metabolism; the ecological roles and importance of fungi; the practical uses of fungi in food and medicine; and the roles of fungi as agents of disease. A special focus is placed on mutualistic and antagonistic interactions of fungi with other organisms. In labs students learn to identify major groups using traditional methods based on morphology and microscopy as well as molecular techniques; aseptic techniques for working with microorganisms; how to culture fungi on artificial media; and how to conduct bioassays for novel antibacterial metabolites produced by fungi. Labs include an experiential project in which students work collaboratively to explore the fungal microbiome of a selected host plant using metabarcoding and methods for isolating asymptomatic fungi from plant tissues. A one-day field trip to a local woodlot provides further experiential learning. Prerequisites: must be in enrolled in a Biology program and have earned at least 53 credits.",

Most visible with the onset of Zoom meetings for mediation, arbitration, and court sessions are the unwitting communications through signals, postures, haptic pauses, bodily spacing, movement, mime, tics and tremors. Those signifiers will not appear on the court transcript but might save or sink a legal outcome. This course calls on interdisciplinary research in law, linguistics, behavioural sciences, the neurological and social sciences, and dispute/conflict resolution to better understand messaging through our movements, treatment of spacing, facial expressions, voice quality, touch behaviour, stance, emotions, and choice of cultural artifacts. This course covers issues, laws, and practice questions that will appeal to students and practitioners of criminal law, criminology, privacy law, Charter law, cybersecurity, health law, civil litigation and dispute resolution, as well as anyone interested more generally in legal anthropology, cultural symbology, semiotics, and communication theory.",

    "description": "This 4th year studio course teaches advanced creative producing skills and practices relevant to the Canadian independent media landscape, focusing on the changing worlds of new media platforms and independent media. Creative Producing addresses every aspect of the creation of new digital media projects (development, prep, production, post-production and release), and is suitable for students who wish to develop advanced hands-on skills in these areas. Each week, a different aspect of creative producing is explored in depth: copyright and contracts, financing and budgeting, co-producing and partnerships, casting and crewing, locations and equipment, vehicles and departments, post picture and sound, festivals and distribution, publicity and outreach. Emerging models for new modes of fiction, doc and alternative projects are studied, exploring how new production models for 360/XR, i-doc, locative media, games and hybrid projects can learn from the best practices and expertise of low-budget and independent media idioms. Each class includes three components: (1) in-depth instruction on some aspect of new media production; (2) the presentation of student research projects, conducting case-studies on the creative production of recent projects; and (3) a guest lecture by an industry professional (producers, funders, distributors), addressing their own experience in relation to that week's specialized topic. Working in teams as their final project assignment, each student creates a detailed development package (proposal, budget, financing plan) for an original new media/independent cinema project. Pre-requisite: FA/CMA 3101 or permission of instructor. Each applicant must submit a current creative CV (with a focus on previous relevant experience in the arts), and a brief one-page letter outlining their interest in this course, and how it applies to their future careers (as producers and/or artists).",

The course develops a contextual understanding of media literacy, identities, embodiments, subcultures, social networks and civic engagements within the lives of youth, analyzing media institutions and policies, consumer cultures, technologies as well as local participatory and transnational practices. Youth are understood in terms of their media uses and productions as learners, consumers, producers and artists across complex relations of power, discursive frameworks and dynamic experiences. Oriented toward conceptualizing \"youth,\" \"culture\" and \"media practices\" in relational, historically nuanced and culturally situated ways, we will examine and undertake qualitative youth media research with critical and reflexive theoretical and methodological tools. Our goal is to balance an understanding of hegemonic forces of commodification controlled by corporate media with emerging and changing relations in which youth collectively transform the conditions, forms and directions of their media participation.

For employees, trade unions bargain all the terms and conditions of employment and often provide training to workers within the construction industry. Also, unlike the non-construction industry, trade unions operate hiring halls and can control the assignment workers to employers. This course explores unique aspects of construction labour law, including 1) how trade unions obtain bargaining rights in the construction industry, 2) the concept of trade jurisdictions held by the various construction trade unions, 3) the concept of sectors within the construction industry, 4) province wide bargaining and sector based bargaining, and 5) the enforcement of collective agreements.

While creativity may be seen as a variable concept across different fields and context, we see commonalities in its description as a process that is shaped and developed through the sociocultural contexts in which it appears. Therefore, this course provides an experimental platform for social agency, developing ideas and creative solutions that can become catalysts for social justice and radical digital citizenship. To compare and contrast production methodologies, motivations and intersections across the arts, sciences and humanities, the course juxtaposes research presentations and experiential activities from broad academic, non-academic and epistemological contexts. This decoupling of practices with traditional mindsets provides a foundation for the student to explore new ideas and processes that deviate or build upon established examples. Students will read widely from key media theorists and creative practitioners, and experience films, sound works and performances. At the same time, they engage in practices of ideation through software and/or hardware prototyping, embracing the ethos of \"making\" as \"thinking in action\". Through this, the student's individual imagination and curiosity form supporting frameworks for exercising critical thinking and problem-solving in the contemporary arts. Classes consist of a blend of presentations on diverse art-technology histories, introductions to AMPD faculty and studios, experiential exercises centered on specific applications and environments, cursory portraits of practices through specific artists across a wide range of fields, and critiques of major projects that combine theoretical and pragmatic approaches.

    "description": "This course presents and analyzes a sequence of basic ideas, topics and problems arising in Economics. For each idea/topic/problem relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of the Economic issue and how it can be resolved, if necessary. The notion of Quantity Demanded is first addressed by expressing quantity demanded as a linear function of price where both the slope and intercept embed important Economics ideas. This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined.

Again, relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of Economic issues and how they can be resolved. The issues and problems covered require functions of more than one variable for their resolution. The notion of Quantity Supplied is combined with the notion of Quantity Demanded and notions of Market Equilibrium are introduced and discussed. Equilibria are evaluated through the introduction of mathematical notions and properties of systems of equations, eventually in matrix form. A deeper understanding of theories of demand (supply) and the foundations of demand (supply) functions is developed through the introduction of mathematical notions of unconstrained and constrained optimization and linear and nonlinear programming. As in AP/ECON 1530 3.00, many topics and issues are addressed and problem framing and problem solving abilities are enhanced. Prerequisite: AP/ECON 1530 3.00 or equivalent.

An introductory review of the central theoretical trends and debates within the field will be offered identifying competing theories and approaches. The relationship between professional knowledge and professional responsibility will be critically analyzed from a range of sociological theoretical perspectives that explain and critique the power and behavior of professions in society. The interaction between knowledge production, academic intellectual inquiry, professionalization and professional practice will be examined. A critical sociological understanding of the processes of professional education and the ways theoretical approaches understand the relations among professional responsibility, professional culture and the workings of and relationship between professions and society will be explored. Issues of diversity and equity facing professions will be raised and analyzed in terms of power relations within and between professions and society.

Multilingual education will be viewed in multiple ways, incorporating internal and international responses to globalization and multiculturalism. In our world today, people live in increasingly multicultural, multilingual countries where historical concepts of belonging are under pressure to respond to current cultural realities. Technological advances of the late twentieth century have simultaneously provided people with the means to move around the globe much more easily and drawn edges of the world closer within virtual space, such that cross-global communications take place in nanoseconds. This has changed language use enormously in terms of both which languages we use most often and the media through which we communicate using these languages.",

With this comes increased population density, economic disparities and increased cultural, ethic, racial and religious diversity. Public institutions, and schools in particular, are charged with the responsibility of addressing the resultant challenges. Using Toronto as an example, the course begins by examining the question: What characterizes urban schools We then go on to examine the historical, social, economis and political issues in the city and investigate how the demographic changes in particular have affected the education system. What changes have occured in the teaching, professional and administrative staff of the schools in term of representation What curricula, programmatic and pedagogical changes have occured? What are the challenges and tensions that the schools face as they attempt to accomodate diverse cultures? Schools in Toronto will be investigated and used as case studies. Through urban theory, field visits and individual assignments we will investigate the extent to which schools' currucula, program and staff representatives are responsive to the needs of today's students. Special attention will be paid to the roles of educators, students and parents in helping address educational, cultural and social issues. The goal of this course, therefore, is to enable students to develop working (tentative and transitional) conceptualizations around the following essential question: how are power, knowledge, identity and cultural representation organized within the space of urban educational encounters?",

The enormous size of today's data sets and the specific requirements of modern applications necessitated the growth of a new generation of data management systems, where the emphasis is put on distributed and fault-tolerant processing. New programming paradigms have evolved, an abundance of information platforms offering data management and analysis solutions appeared and a number of novel methods and tools have been developed. This course introduces the fundamentals of big data storage, retrieval, and processing systems. As these fundamentals are introduced, exemplary technologies are used to illustrate how big data systems can leverage very large data sets that become available through multiple sources and are characterized by diverse levels of volume (terabytes; billion records), velocity (batch; real-time; streaming) and variety (structured; semi-structured; unstructured). The course aims to provide students with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience of the field by covering recent research on big data systems and their basic properties. Students consider both small and large datasets because both are equally important and justify different trade-offs. Topics include: software frameworks for distributed storage and processing of very large data sets, MapReduce programming model, querying of structured data sets, column stores, key-value stores, document stores, graph databases, distributed stream processing frameworks.

    "description": "Behavioural ecology focuses on the behavioural interactions among individuals at both the intraspecific level in natural populations and the interspecific level in natural communities. Behavioural ecology asks questions about proximate and ultimate causes of behaviour, the development of behaviour, the flexibility of behaviour and learning, the adaptive value of behaviour for survival and reproduction, and the phylogenetic relationships among diverse behavioural patterns. In an overarching sense, it considers behavioural interactions against the metric of evolutionary fitness. A common focus of behavioural ecologists' research is to consider how efficiently animals use their time and energy in obtaining mates and resources against measures of survival and reproductive success, including analyses of the trade-offs associated with optimizing the use of time and energy. This course explores the many behavioural contexts that are manifest in natural populations of animals. Major themes include (a) behaviours under competition, including evolutionary stable strategies, frequency dependence,and the application of game theory; (b) behavioural plasticity; (c) changing behaviours in environments of changing or complex selective pressures; (d) territorial behaviour and economic defendability; (e) sex-specific patterns of behaviour in the mating realm, including the operation of sexual selection, the phylogeny of mating systems, the mediation of challenges based in sexual conflict, and behaviourally flexible alternative mating strategies; (f) patterns of behaviour related to parenting, including mother-father conflict, parent offspring conflict, and sibling conflict; (g) both antagonistic and cooperative social behaviours, including alloparenting and the special case of social insects;and (h) communication and signaling behaviours in diverse sensory realms.

Managers are literally bombarded with data (the information overload problem) and must be able to filter and assess the quality of such data before inputting into managerial decision models. The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question. Managers read and possibly rely on many research reports over their careers and it is important to be able to distinguish good research from weak research.",

Part I (Legal Research) - Description Part I of this course teaches students the basic techniques of legal research relevant to Canadian Law, which is essential for legal studies and is a fundamental tool of the lawyering profession in Canada. In this course, students will learn the different categories of legal information and how they are published, organized, and indexed. In addition to learning traditional research methods, students will also be trained to use computer-assisted legal research, including major legal databases such as LexisNexis/Quicklaw, Westlaw Canada, and CCH Online. The purpose of Part I of this course is also to provide international graduate students with the essential skills to identify, locate, and understand legal materials relevant to business scenarios around the world. Therefore, not only Canadian, but also the US, foreign, and international legal research resources will be reviewed. Part II (Legal Writing) - Description Fundamentally, the materials, classes and evaluation methods for Part II of the course are designed to: (1) assist students to use the legal research skills acquired in Part I to create legal documents; (2) assist students to acquire the tools required to perform sound legal writing; (3) assist students to develop ways to analyze legal problems that will be applied both during and after the IBL program; and (4) assist students to use provided frameworks to create a range of commonly used legal documents within the Canadian legal system. During Part II of the course, students will have the opportunity to complete a number of assignments which progressively build upon analytical and writing skills. The primarily assignment-based nature of this part of the course requires a significant and \"steady\" time commitment",

It uses cultural sources such as film, photography, literature and music to see how the experience of the modern European city has been represented from the nineteenth century to the present day. The course also uses the history of the modern European city to explore historical issues such as the experience of war, poverty and wealth, social reform, and the growth of cosmopolitanism and multiracialism. It explores the material space of urban development by looking at architecture, urban planning and housing. The course reflects upon current social and political issues in the modern European city, such as gentrification, popular protest and globalization. Though the course will discuss the culture and history of European cities, it focuses upon the examples of Paris and London from the mid nineteenth century to the present day. The course will explore the human experience of modern European cities, including discussions of race, gender, sexuality and class in the modern city, the physical shape of cities, and the cultural representation of city life. Particular topics covered include popular culture from café life to dancehalls; the photography of twentieth-century Paris; cosmopolitanism and the modern city; class conflicts in the city; the city on screen; fashion and postwar Paris and London; and radical movements in the city. Sources include novels such as Therèse Raquin by Emile Zola and Absolute Beginners by Colin MacInnes, the photography of Robert Frank and Roger Mayne and documents on the London Blitz. The emphasis in this course is developing skills such as analytical thinking, reading and writing.

    "description": "This course examines children's perspectives on their own lives and experiences in specific cultural, social and/or community contexts. Children's cultures are explored outside the parameters of adulthood, as a distinctive phase during which children are bearers and creators of an intricate social system that negotiates and influences their relationships with the world around them. This course explores how children perceive their own culture and how issues such as race, class, culture, gender, sexuality and ethnicity affect children in a globalized world. Rather than studying the unified concept of \"childhood\" this course embodies the idea that children in globalized communities create and foster their own distinct culture/s. Throughout the course students in the class are challenged to expand their ideas and preconceived notions of childhood and critically examine how culture, society and/or community contribute to our understanding of childhood through specific and focused contexts. Course credit exclusions: None. Note: Priority will be given to Children's Studies and Humanities majors and minors.",

    "description": "Urban communities are typically spatial centres to which individuals migrate and immigrate. With this comes increased population density, economic disparities and increased cultural, ethic, racial and religious diversity. Public institutions, and schools in particular, are charged with the responsibility of addressing the resultant challenges. Using Toronto as an example, the course begins by examining the question: What characterizes urban schools We then go on to examine the historical, social, economis and political issues in the city and investigate how the demographic changes in particular have affected the education system. What changes have occured in the teaching, professional and administrative staff of the schools in term of representation What curricula, programmatic and pedagogical changes have occured? What are the challenges and tensions that the schools face as they attempt to accomodate diverse cultures? Schools in Toronto will be investigated and used as case studies. Through urban theory, field visits and individual assignments we will investigate the extent to which schools' currucula, program and staff representatives are responsive to the needs of today's students. Special attention will be paid to the roles of educators, students and parents in helping address educational, cultural and social issues. The goal of this course, therefore, is to enable students to develop working (tentative and transitional) conceptualizations around the following essential question: how are power, knowledge, identity and cultural representation organized within the space of urban educational encounters?",

    "description": "The term, multilingual education, typically refers to the teaching of and through more than two languages. This means that multilingual education is concerned with language policy. Language choices and uses in education reflect social policy decisions within a multicultural or cross-cultural context. In this course, we investigate language policy, education, ecology, and hegemony in our changing world. Multilingual education will be viewed in multiple ways, incorporating internal and international responses to globalization and multiculturalism. In our world today, people live in increasingly multicultural, multilingual countries where historical concepts of belonging are under pressure to respond to current cultural realities. Technological advances of the late twentieth century have simultaneously provided people with the means to move around the globe much more easily and drawn edges of the world closer within virtual space, such that cross-global communications take place in nanoseconds. This has changed language use enormously in terms of both which languages we use most often and the media through which we communicate using these languages.",

    "description": "This course explores the study, use and meaning of astronomy in different human cultures with a special focus on non-western cultures. Students learn how different human cultures have understood and interpreted the observed celestial phenomena throughout history and how this perception played a role in their understanding of human origins and its relationship to nature. Students approach astronomical concepts through the lens of archaeoastronomy (defined as the exploration of astronomical practices in ancient cultures) and ethnoastronomy (defined as the study of astronomical practices by different cultures around the world). Topics includes celestial myths and their role in understanding/describing natural events, origins of astrology, cultural interpretations of the motions of the stars, planets, the Moon, and the Sun, methods of navigation and timekeeping, different calendars, and puzzles that have inspired important shifts in our understanding of the Universe. The course examines varying cultural conceptions of astronomy and how those conceptions function in different human societies on social, political, economic, and religious levels.

Since the year 2000, there has been a nearly continuous presence of humanity in space. These accomplishments are incredible considering that space is an extremely inhospitable environment due to low temperatures and pressure, microgravity, harmful radiation, meteoroids, and debris. This course begins with a discussion of historical and contemporary motivations for establishing a human presence in space. This is followed by an examination of the past, present, and potential future of human space travel. Students learn how both the space environment and the surface environments of other worlds in our solar system affect the human body. The course also explores the various technologies and methods used to mitigate these effects as much as possible. By the end of the course, students will have an understanding of the challenges faced by human space travel, be able to evaluate the plausibility of establishing off-world settlements, be familiar with how space law influences human space travel, and discuss theories for traveling beyond our solar system.",

This is historically true of cocaine, heroin, and amphetamines, and now also syntenic opioids like Fentanyl. Those dividing lines are drawn on both a biochemical and societal basis, and it is biomedical and social processes that lead to their development. This multidisciplinary course analyzes the nature and intersection of pharmaceuticals, science and society. The course begins with a brief historical overview of the chemical and institutional history of pharmaceuticals, and the birth of the pharmaceutical industry. We then track the multiphase process of pharmaceutical drug development through numerous scientific, political, regulatory, medical, as well as business and innovation practices. In each phase of drug research, development and deployment, we identify and analyze key scientific and societal issues. The course discusses how medicines like vaccines, antibiotics, stem cell and immunotherapies have collectively saved millions of lives while building some of the largest industrial sectors in the world. The course also examines the connections between public taxpayer investment in pre-clinical scientific work and privatization into for-profit commercial ventures. We track how the scientific method influences clinical trials as well as the various degrees of protection and controls for research participants. The course shows the chemical and biological basis upon which drugs are regulated and licensed in Canada, and how they end up on provincial drug plans (or not). We explore the power of the pharmaceutical industry in the marketing of drugs and the manipulation of biological information, and how they shape the prescribing practices of doctors. The course concludes by exploring statistical elements of defining rare diseases and the access and availability challenges for drugs for rare diseases.",

We begin by studying how gravity triggers fusion reactions in starts that create heat, light, and every element in our bodies except hydrogen: overall, stars shine by converting mass into energy (Einstein's E=mc^2). We discuss how we can use the corpses of stars (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes) to probe how space and time are related via Einstein's theories of relativity. We examine how stars are bound together into galaxies by gravity and how to use various wavelengths of light to determine why there are different types of galaxies: elegant spirals, massive ellipticals, and faint dwarf galaxies. We learn how the Doppler effect reveals that dark matter must produce some of the gravity that binds stars into galaxies, galaxies into clusters of galaxies, and clusters of galaxies into superclusters. We explore how we can use distant galaxies to study the development of the universe over its entire history, including the increasing importance of dark energy. We confront both the earliest instants and the far future of our universe's history: what we know, what we still hope to learn, and what we think we can ever learn.

Or have you wondered why the frequency of these natural hazards seems to be increasing in recent years? The study of the Earth and its processes helps us better understand the type, location, and intensity of natural hazards such as tsunamis, volcanoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes. In this course students examine the Earth processes that drive natural hazards and develop an understanding of how these hazards impact human society as well as the surrounding environment. Students analyze ways in which humans can better adjust to the impacts of natural hazards and discuss management and mitigation options and policies. The impact of climate change on the frequency and severity of natural hazards is discussed and potential solutions to climate change to minimize their impact is reviewed. Prerequisites: None.

For each case we first cover a 'primer' on the technical issues - for instance learning how a gene codes for a protein - so that after this course when you come across such material you'll be better able to correctly grasp the relevant points. But we also study the enduring tension between expertise and democratic populism, the distinction between risk and uncertainty, and whether ignorance is a lack of knowledge....or the wrong knowledge confidently held.

The impact of measuring and marking time intervals on the development of human culture, and our understanding of the world around us, cannot be understated. The drive to measure and understand time led ancient peoples to a very sophisticated knowledge of the sky; from that knowledge emerged accurate calendars, as well as mathematics itself. We will look at how changing concepts of time and the technological accuracy of measuring time drove fundamental changes in physics, and deepened our understanding of the world around us. The first half of the course covers timekeeping methods, including the sky as a clock, mechanical clocks, and quartz and atomic clocks. The second half of the course focuses on modern issues of time including time perception, Einstein's revolutionary discoveries on the relative nature of time, and cosmic time.

    "description": "The course explores technical and philosophical approaches to creativity and its manifestations through interdisciplinary modes of artistic production. While creativity may be seen as a variable concept across different fields and context, we see commonalities in its description as a process that is shaped and developed through the sociocultural contexts in which it appears. Therefore, this course provides an experimental platform for social agency, developing ideas and creative solutions that can become catalysts for social justice and radical digital citizenship. To compare and contrast production methodologies, motivations and intersections across the arts, sciences and humanities, the course juxtaposes research presentations and experiential activities from broad academic, non-academic and epistemological contexts. This decoupling of practices with traditional mindsets provides a foundation for the student to explore new ideas and processes that deviate or build upon established examples. Students will read widely from key media theorists and creative practitioners, and experience films, sound works and performances. At the same time, they engage in practices of ideation through software and/or hardware prototyping, embracing the ethos of \"making\" as \"thinking in action\". Through this, the student's individual imagination and curiosity form supporting frameworks for exercising critical thinking and problem-solving in the contemporary arts. Classes consist of a blend of presentations on diverse art-technology histories, introductions to AMPD faculty and studios, experiential exercises centered on specific applications and environments, cursory portraits of practices through specific artists across a wide range of fields, and critiques of major projects that combine theoretical and pragmatic approaches.

Key feature of this approach is to blend multiple research strategies in the pursuit of output that cannot be predetermined. Grounded in cultural production, this approach has gained traction as a multi-disciplinary tool used by designers, academics, artist and scientists to address complex research questions through creativity & innovation. Students will be exposed to multiple approaches to research creation as a tool for academic exploration, while demonstrating a thorough grasp of the key concepts through the development & execution of course projects. The theoretical foundations of this course will be two-fold by providing a firm academic understanding of current research creation practices in academia and beyond. Through sourcing & investigation of scholarly articles & primary sources students will develop the ability to acutely frame research questions & develop applicable creative methodologies on which to base their research. Through a series of assignments and projects students are expected to develop an ability to evaluate the appropriateness of different approaches to artistic creation using well established ideas & techniques. As the course progresses, students will develop their own skills & techniques that will be applied in the execution of their own research creation project. This course will be a hybrid studio/seminar course where students are expected to develop skills as both researcher & artist. Weekly presentations by students and the course leader will build on the understanding of this approach, accumulating in final presentations of student projects. Visit to galleries, research laboratories, artist studios and presentation venues or other timely events will be incorporated into the course in order to augment student learning.",

    "description": "This course engages the Electro-Acoustic Orchestra (EAO) as a context for extending digital instruments for expressive sound synthesis and processing that were developed in the first course in the sequence (DATT/MUSI/PANF 3070). It provides an opportunity for established EAO members to refine their digital performance practice by introducing more advanced features, such as real-time processing of acoustic players, interactive systems based on sound analysis, hybrid analog/digital systems, and virtual acoustics. DATT, MUSI and PANF 3070/4070 sections all meet together in order to form the larger ensemble. The EAO engages in regular improvisation sessions as a means to further develop attentiveness to all aspects of sound including timbre, texture, blending noise/tone, and blending acoustic/electronic sources in space. Assignments focus on refining these more advanced digital instruments so that students can flexibly meet the demands of performing in this challenging ensemble context. Compositions drawn from the experimental and electroacoustic literature are performed, as are new pieces which draw on the EAO's unique gestural conducting language. The orchestra will present their work via public performances, in collaboration with the instructor and invited guest artists. Open to non-majors. Prerequisite: FA/MUSI 3070 3.00.

    "description": "In special circumstances, students may take, for credit and in place of regular seminar courses, a reading course directed by a member of the faculty, which should consist of individual tutorial sessions at least once a month. Students must present sufficient written work to form a basis for discussions and for assessment of progress. Directed reading courses are intended to enable students to pursue a research interest not covered by any of the seminar courses offered in that year; to enable them to explore an unfamiliar topic with a view to making it the topic of the thesis or dissertation; or to fill a gap in their knowledge which might impede their special research. M.A. students may not substitute more than one, or Ph.D. students more than two directed readings for regular seminar courses. Directed reading courses are given ex gratia by members of the faculty and the approval of the Program Director must be obtained in advance. This will not normally be given unless the Director is satisfied that the student has the appropriate background to pursue the course at a suitably advanced level.",

It provides an opportunity for established EAO members to refine their digital performance practice by introducing more advanced features, such as real-time processing of acoustic players, interactive systems based on sound analysis, hybrid analog/digital systems, and virtual acoustics. DATT, MUSI and PANF 3070/4070 sections all meet together in order to form the larger ensemble. The EAO engages in regular improvisation sessions as a means to further develop attentiveness to all aspects of sound including timbre, texture, blending noise/tone, and blending acoustic/electronic sources in space. Assignments focus on refining these more advanced digital instruments so that students can flexibly meet the demands of performing in this challenging ensemble context. Compositions drawn from the experimental and electroacoustic literature are performed, as are new pieces which draw on the EAO's unique gestural conducting language. The orchestra will present their work via public performances, in collaboration with the instructor and invited guest artists. Open to non-majors. Prerequisite: FA/MUSI 3070 3.00.

    "description": "This Experiential Education course is designed to engage students in creating three-dimensional, non-wearable sculpture in soft materials such as textiles, flexible foam and paper. Through a combination of presentations and hands-on studio projects, this course will explore soft materials as a sculptural medium, and contextualize the use of soft materials in both historical and contemporary frameworks of artistic production, emphasizing individual, process-based approaches to creative problem solving. The sculptural processes surrounding fabrication of soft sculptures introduces students to a range of sculptural methodologies and skills employing pattern drafting, assembly, and material manipulation. Through in-class demonstrations students are introduced to a range of skills and tools to be utilized in the production of their studio projects. Assignments consist of a series of projects exploring different working processes and sculptural methodologies. In addition to these projects, in-class discussions, technical assignments and readings engage students in the dialogue surrounding contemporary sculptural concerns such as form, process and spatial awareness. Craftsmanship and a demonstrated knowledge of materials are a major factor in this course. In order for students to be able to fully articulate their idea in a given material, they must understand the limits and possibilities inherent in the fabrication process. It is expected that each student will develop a degree of sophistication and competence when working with these material processes. Lectures, demonstrations, group critiques and hands-on instruction are the essential means by which we will investigate sculptural problem-solving. The class participates in material specific demonstrations, technical assignments and class critiques of finished work. Periodically there will be in-class work periods, but it is expected that the majority of the assignments will be completed outside of class time.",

    "description": "This Experiential Education course is designed to engage students in creating three-dimensional, non-wearable sculpture in soft materials such as textiles, flexible foam and paper. Through a combination of presentations and hands-on studio projects, this course will explore soft materials as a sculptural medium, and contextualize the use of soft materials in both historical and contemporary frameworks of artistic production, emphasizing individual, process-based approaches to creative problem solving. The sculptural processes surrounding fabrication of soft sculptures introduces students to a range of sculptural methodologies and skills employing pattern drafting, assembly, and material manipulation. Through in-class demonstrations students are introduced to a range of skills and tools to be utilized in the production of their studio projects. Assignments consist of a series of projects exploring different working processes and sculptural methodologies. In addition to these projects, in-class discussions, technical assignments and readings engage students in the dialogue surrounding contemporary sculptural concerns such as form, process and spatial awareness. Craftsmanship and a demonstrated knowledge of materials are a major factor in this course. In order for students to be able to fully articulate their idea in a given material, they must understand the limits and possibilities inherent in the fabrication process. It is expected that each student will develop a degree of sophistication and competence when working with these material processes.
