Classes consist of a blend of slide lectures, video screenings, student presentations, and group discussion. Classes are organized thematically with weekly topics that will include combinations of the following topics: print, performance, photography, television, cinema, video, animation, systems, networks, surveillance, the body, games and play, social media, virtual worlds, simulation, ecologies, digital decay, and the postdigital. To support this topical breadth this course draws readings from a variety of disciplines that include art history, cinema and media studies, game studies, anthropology, and environmental criticism. By the end of this course students will have gained a broad understanding of the many fluid theoretical relationships between contemporary art and technology, as well as a more specific historical knowledge of key figures and objects with the new media art canon.

In this course we will ask both descriptive and normative questions. That is, what promises will the state enforce and how can we justify state coercion as a means of enforcing promises. This course is intended to help students develop an understanding of the various theoretical underpinnings of contract law and an ability to discern patterns in judicial enforcement. This course does not involve simply the memorization of fixed, immutable rules and principles.

This course is designed to look directly at those issues. Specifically, this course provides an introduction to the Canadian legal profession, professional rules, norms and values, regulatory institutions and processes, and the practical ethical issues that lawyers face. It focuses on the context of the Canadian lawyer's many and varied roles: as advocate, advisor, employee, employer, entrepreneur or public servant. It considers the various contexts in which lawyers work: in solo practice, firm practice, government practice or in-house. It also examines lawyers as members of a profession with collective responsibilities in relation to the public interest and access to justice. The course situates these issues within their modern-day context; that is, within a context characterized by local diverse communities, normative pluralism, globalization and transnationalism.

    "description": "This course covers the core concepts in two foundational areas of the Canadian common law -- contract and tort -- by combining that material into one course. There are two overarching bases for the decision to combine contract and torts into one course. First, there is a natural overlap between these two substantive areas of law and as such there is a strong pedagogical reason for the study of these two areas in one course. Second, candidates for the LL.M. program will benefit from the additional opportunity provided to them to take one further subject course instead of taking two separate courses. From a pedagogical standpoint, there is merit to this combination of courses as it affords occasion to talk about the shape and inter-relationship of the common law categories. As this course is envisioned as an introduction, there is an effort to guide candidates through these legal disciplines in a manner that speaks to the distinct features as well as the overlapping points of each. The introduction to the course illustrates to candidates a common origin for contract and torts; thereby underlining the basis of the combination. Beginning with the discussion of remedies, the contemporary connection between contract and torts will be explored in more detail. Finally, candidates are taken through the business/economic scenarios in which contract and torts overlap."

Behavioural ecology asks questions about proximate and ultimate causes of behaviour, the development of behaviour, the flexibility of behaviour and learning, the adaptive value of behaviour for survival and reproduction, and the phylogenetic relationships among diverse behavioural patterns. In an overarching sense, it considers behavioural interactions against the metric of evolutionary fitness. A common focus of behavioural ecologists' research is to consider how efficiently animals use their time and energy in obtaining mates and resources against measures of survival and reproductive success, including analyses of the trade-offs associated with optimizing the use of time and energy. This course explores the many behavioural contexts that are manifest in natural populations of animals. Major themes include (a) behaviours under competition, including evolutionary stable strategies, frequency dependence,and the application of game theory; (b) behavioural plasticity; (c) changing behaviours in environments of changing or complex selective pressures; (d) territorial behaviour and economic defendability; (e) sex-specific patterns of behaviour in the mating realm, including the operation of sexual selection, the phylogeny of mating systems, the mediation of challenges based in sexual conflict, and behaviourally flexible alternative mating strategies; (f) patterns of behaviour related to parenting, including mother-father conflict, parent offspring conflict, and sibling conflict; (g) both antagonistic and cooperative social behaviours, including alloparenting and the special case of social insects;and (h) communication and signaling behaviours in diverse sensory realms.

We will attempt to come to terms with what W.J.T. Mitchell has called the \"\"pictorial turn\"\" in all its complexity. The course includes works by philosophers and cultural theorists as well as poets, painters, novelists, videographers, filmmakers, and cyberneticists."

In what ways are the patterns of story woven into our lives, our society, our world? Or are we and our world woven by the patterns of story? Biology of Story is a 24-week, largely asynchronous, fully online course. Proceeding from the practical insights of those who tell stories in many forms, the course will also explore the growing use of narrative in a wide range of fields towards rethinking social and institutional assumptions and releasing human potential. Ranging across multiple Creative Arts (Film & Television, Interactive & Transmedia, Oral Literature & Folklore, Literature & Creative Writing), Humanities (Native Studies, Education, Religious Studies, Psychology, Journalism, Peace & Conflict Studies) and Sciences (Life Sciences, Cosmology, Health & Medicine), the course will follow the thread of story as it informs, and is informed by, each discipline. A range of learning activities will involve students in individual and group work equally demanding of analytical rigour, creative imagination, and personal reflection; while building first-year University skills at research, writing, and informed discussion. Key insights from the cultural knowledge of First Nations and other indigenous peoples, traditionally rooted in story, will frame the course's epistemological approach. Open to non-majors.

Emerging models for new modes of fiction, doc and alternative projects are studied, exploring how new production models for 360/XR, i-doc, locative media, games and hybrid projects can learn from the best practices and expertise of low-budget and independent media idioms. Each class includes three components: (1) in-depth instruction on some aspect of new media production; (2) the presentation of student research projects, conducting case-studies on the creative production of recent projects; and (3) a guest lecture by an industry professional (producers, funders, distributors), addressing their own experience in relation to that week's specialized topic.

    "description": "This course examines a number of key issues confronting Canadian media and communications policy today such as: concentration of ownership; copyright; financialization; convergence; net neutrality; spectrum allocation; and digital policy. Framed as a series of case studies, it illustrates how policy development is a lively and dynamic process as different social interests vie for ownership of, access to, and representation within, media forms. At the same time, it shows how electronic media in Canada are a unique product of the institutions and forces that shape Canadian society, and how the modes of representation they realize are structured within a dynamic web of local, regional, national and transnational relationships. It is particularly concerned with: i) the ways the process of development determines access to these systems and the ways in which the benefits they realize are both structured and allocated; and ii) set in this context, what might be the prerequisites and determinants for sound policy in each of these areas/fields. This course was previously offered as AP/COMN 4215 3.00."

For employees, trade unions bargain all the terms and conditions of employment and often provide training to workers within the construction industry. Also, unlike the non-construction industry, trade unions operate hiring halls and can control the assignment workers to employers. This course explores unique aspects of construction labour law, including 1) how trade unions obtain bargaining rights in the construction industry, 2) the concept of trade jurisdictions held by the various construction trade unions, 3) the concept of sectors within the construction industry, 4) province wide bargaining and sector based bargaining, and 5) the enforcement of collective agreements.

While creativity may be seen as a variable concept across different fields and context, we see commonalities in its description as a process that is shaped and developed through the sociocultural contexts in which it appears. Therefore, this course provides an experimental platform for social agency, developing ideas and creative solutions that can become catalysts for social justice and radical digital citizenship. To compare and contrast production methodologies, motivations and intersections across the arts, sciences and humanities, the course juxtaposes research presentations and experiential activities from broad academic, non-academic and epistemological contexts. This decoupling of practices with traditional mindsets provides a foundation for the student to explore new ideas and processes that deviate or build upon established examples. Students will read widely from key media theorists and creative practitioners, and experience films, sound works and performances. At the same time, they engage in practices of ideation through software and/or hardware prototyping, embracing the ethos of \"making\" as \"thinking in action\". Through this, the student's individual imagination and curiosity form supporting frameworks for exercising critical thinking and problem-solving in the contemporary arts. Classes consist of a blend of presentations on diverse art-technology histories, introductions to AMPD faculty and studios, experiential exercises centered on specific applications and environments, cursory portraits of practices through specific artists across a wide range of fields, and critiques of major projects that combine theoretical and pragmatic approaches.

Alongside the creation of creative works students will be guided through several teamwork exercises and methodologies, such as Agile, Scrum, guided reflection, team worksheets, written reflection, surveys, games and other relevant activities. Students will learn how to structure and develop team vision, task management, effectively communicate abstract concepts, and to maintain empathy for fellow teammates. Students will also be asked to analyse 'how' a work is accomplished in order to develop strategies for the next stage of project development. This course will require ongoing critical reflection, observation and analysis, and cyclical review to help students to iteratively develop interpersonal skills and ability to work on teams. The final creative projects created in class will be presented to the public during a final public exhibition.

For each idea/topic/problem relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of the Economic issue and how it can be resolved, if necessary. The notion of Quantity Demanded is first addressed by expressing quantity demanded as a linear function of price where both the slope and intercept embed important Economics ideas. This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined.

Again, relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of Economic issues and how they can be resolved. The issues and problems covered require functions of more than one variable for their resolution. The notion of Quantity Supplied is combined with the notion of Quantity Demanded and notions of Market Equilibrium are introduced and discussed. Equilibria are evaluated through the introduction of mathematical notions and properties of systems of equations, eventually in matrix form. A deeper understanding of theories of demand (supply) and the foundations of demand (supply) functions is developed through the introduction of mathematical notions of unconstrained and constrained optimization and linear and nonlinear programming.

In this course, we investigate language policy, education, ecology, and hegemony in our changing world. Multilingual education will be viewed in multiple ways, incorporating internal and international responses to globalization and multiculturalism. In our world today, people live in increasingly multicultural, multilingual countries where historical concepts of belonging are under pressure to respond to current cultural realities. Technological advances of the late twentieth century have simultaneously provided people with the means to move around the globe much more easily and drawn edges of the world closer within virtual space, such that cross-global communications take place in nanoseconds. This has changed language use enormously in terms of both which languages we use most often and the media through which we communicate using these languages."

With this comes increased population density, economic disparities and increased cultural, ethic, racial and religious diversity. Public institutions, and schools in particular, are charged with the responsibility of addressing the resultant challenges. Using Toronto as an example, the course begins by examining the question: What characterizes urban schools We then go on to examine the historical, social, economis and political issues in the city and investigate how the demographic changes in particular have affected the education system. What changes have occured in the teaching, professional and administrative staff of the schools in term of representation What curricula, programmatic and pedagogical changes have occured? What are the challenges and tensions that the schools face as they attempt to accomodate diverse cultures? Schools in Toronto will be investigated and used as case studies. Through urban theory, field visits and individual assignments we will investigate the extent to which schools' currucula, program and staff representatives are responsive to the needs of today's students. Special attention will be paid to the roles of educators, students and parents in helping address educational, cultural and social issues. The goal of this course, therefore, is to enable students to develop working (tentative and transitional) conceptualizations around the following essential question: how are power, knowledge, identity and cultural representation organized within the space of urban educational encounters?"

Behavioural ecology asks questions about proximate and ultimate causes of behaviour, the development of behaviour, the flexibility of behaviour and learning, the adaptive value of behaviour for survival and reproduction, and the phylogenetic relationships among diverse behavioural patterns. In an overarching sense, it considers behavioural interactions against the metric of evolutionary fitness. A common focus of behavioural ecologists' research is to consider how efficiently animals use their time and energy in obtaining mates and resources against measures of survival and reproductive success, including analyses of the trade-offs associated with optimizing the use of time and energy. This course explores the many behavioural contexts that are manifest in natural populations of animals. Major themes include (a) behaviours under competition, including evolutionary stable strategies, frequency dependence,and the application of game theory; (b) behavioural plasticity; (c) changing behaviours in environments of changing or complex selective pressures; (d) territorial behaviour and economic defendability; (e) sex-specific patterns of behaviour in the mating realm, including the operation of sexual selection, the phylogeny of mating systems, the mediation of challenges based in sexual conflict, and behaviourally flexible alternative mating strategies; (f) patterns of behaviour related to parenting, including mother-father conflict, parent offspring conflict, and sibling conflict; (g) both antagonistic and cooperative social behaviours, including alloparenting and the special case of social insects;and (h) communication and signaling behaviours in diverse sensory realms.

Managers are literally bombarded with data (the information overload problem) and must be able to filter and assess the quality of such data before inputting into managerial decision models. The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question. Managers read and possibly rely on many research reports over their careers and it is important to be able to distinguish good research from weak research."

Part I (Legal Research) - Description Part I of this course teaches students the basic techniques of legal research relevant to Canadian Law, which is essential for legal studies and is a fundamental tool of the lawyering profession in Canada. In this course, students will learn the different categories of legal information and how they are published, organized, and indexed. In addition to learning traditional research methods, students will also be trained to use computer-assisted legal research, including major legal databases such as LexisNexis/Quicklaw, Westlaw Canada, and CCH Online. The purpose of Part I of this course is also to provide international graduate students with the essential skills to identify, locate, and understand legal materials relevant to business scenarios around the world. Therefore, not only Canadian, but also the US, foreign, and international legal research resources will be reviewed. Part II (Legal Writing) - Description Fundamentally, the materials, classes and evaluation methods for Part II of the course are designed to: (1) assist students to use the legal research skills acquired in Part I to create legal documents; (2) assist students to acquire the tools required to perform sound legal writing; (3) assist students to develop ways to analyze legal problems that will be applied both during and after the IBL program; and (4) assist students to use provided frameworks to create a range of commonly used legal documents within the Canadian legal system. During Part II of the course, students will have the opportunity to complete a number of assignments which progressively build upon analytical and writing skills. The primarily assignment-based nature of this part of the course requires a significant and \"steady\" time commitment"

It uses cultural sources such as film, photography, literature and music to see how the experience of the modern European city has been represented from the nineteenth century to the present day. The course also uses the history of the modern European city to explore historical issues such as the experience of war, poverty and wealth, social reform, and the growth of cosmopolitanism and multiracialism. It explores the material space of urban development by looking at architecture, urban planning and housing. The course reflects upon current social and political issues in the modern European city, such as gentrification, popular protest and globalization. Though the course will discuss the culture and history of European cities, it focuses upon the examples of Paris and London from the mid nineteenth century to the present day. The course will explore the human experience of modern European cities, including discussions of race, gender, sexuality and class in the modern city, the physical shape of cities, and the cultural representation of city life. Particular topics covered include popular culture from café life to dancehalls; the photography of twentieth-century Paris; cosmopolitanism and the modern city; class conflicts in the city; the city on screen; fashion and postwar Paris and London; and radical movements in the city. Sources include novels such as Therèse Raquin by Emile Zola and Absolute Beginners by Colin MacInnes, the photography of Robert Frank and Roger Mayne and documents on the London Blitz. The emphasis in this course is developing skills such as analytical thinking, reading and writing.

    "description": "Urban communities are typically spatial centres to which individuals migrate and immigrate. With this comes increased population density, economic disparities and increased cultural, ethic, racial and religious diversity. Public institutions, and schools in particular, are charged with the responsibility of addressing the resultant challenges. Using Toronto as an example, the course begins by examining the question: What characterizes urban schools We then go on to examine the historical, social, economis and political issues in the city and investigate how the demographic changes in particular have affected the education system. What changes have occured in the teaching, professional and administrative staff of the schools in term of representation What curricula, programmatic and pedagogical changes have occured? What are the challenges and tensions that the schools face as they attempt to accomodate diverse cultures? Schools in Toronto will be investigated and used as case studies. Through urban theory, field visits and individual assignments we will investigate the extent to which schools' currucula, program and staff representatives are responsive to the needs of today's students. Special attention will be paid to the roles of educators, students and parents in helping address educational, cultural and social issues. The goal of this course, therefore, is to enable students to develop working (tentative and transitional) conceptualizations around the following essential question: how are power, knowledge, identity and cultural representation organized within the space of urban educational encounters?"

This means that multilingual education is concerned with language policy. Language choices and uses in education reflect social policy decisions within a multicultural or cross-cultural context. In this course, we investigate language policy, education, ecology, and hegemony in our changing world. Multilingual education will be viewed in multiple ways, incorporating internal and international responses to globalization and multiculturalism. In our world today, people live in increasingly multicultural, multilingual countries where historical concepts of belonging are under pressure to respond to current cultural realities. Technological advances of the late twentieth century have simultaneously provided people with the means to move around the globe much more easily and drawn edges of the world closer within virtual space, such that cross-global communications take place in nanoseconds. This has changed language use enormously in terms of both which languages we use most often and the media through which we communicate using these languages."

At all levels, learning can be thought of as research: an active construction of personal knowledge, based on formulating and testing hypotheses and, in light of an evaluation of the results, modifying one's beliefs and practices. In this spirit, we shall attempt to make connections between the reading, writing and discussion that take place in the course, and the reading, writing and discussion of the classroom setting. Class sessions will vary in format and will include discussions of the readings which are set for each week, lectures, guest presentations and work on individual and group projects.

    "description": "Human beings have long desired to travel amongst the stars, with the 20th century yielding the first human in space, humans walking on the moon, the operation of a space shuttle and the construction of a massive international space station. Since the year 2000, there has been a nearly continuous presence of humanity in space. These accomplishments are incredible considering that space is an extremely inhospitable environment due to low temperatures and pressure, microgravity, harmful radiation, meteoroids, and debris. This course begins with a discussion of historical and contemporary motivations for establishing a human presence in space. This is followed by an examination of the past, present, and potential future of human space travel. Students learn how both the space environment and the surface environments of other worlds in our solar system affect the human body. The course also explores the various technologies and methods used to mitigate these effects as much as possible. By the end of the course, students will have an understanding of the challenges faced by human space travel, be able to evaluate the plausibility of establishing off-world settlements, be familiar with how space law influences human space travel, and discuss theories for traveling beyond our solar system."

While the space environment and other planets may not possess the ideal conditions for life as we know it on Earth, life has proven itself to be resilient in a variety of extreme environments. This course begins by introducing students to the biology of life on Earth. Students then learn how different lifeforms are affected by the space environment and what steps can be taken to mitigate these effects in order for life to survive in space. We then look beyond Earth and evaluate the habitability of other moons and planets, both in our solar system and beyond. Finally, we discuss the search for alien life and potential theories of how alien life might form and develop on other worlds. No previous background in Astronomy, nor any science, is required.

This is historically true of cocaine, heroin, and amphetamines, and now also syntenic opioids like Fentanyl. Those dividing lines are drawn on both a biochemical and societal basis, and it is biomedical and social processes that lead to their development. This multidisciplinary course analyzes the nature and intersection of pharmaceuticals, science and society. The course begins with a brief historical overview of the chemical and institutional history of pharmaceuticals, and the birth of the pharmaceutical industry. We then track the multiphase process of pharmaceutical drug development through numerous scientific, political, regulatory, medical, as well as business and innovation practices. In each phase of drug research, development and deployment, we identify and analyze key scientific and societal issues. The course discusses how medicines like vaccines, antibiotics, stem cell and immunotherapies have collectively saved millions of lives while building some of the largest industrial sectors in the world. The course also examines the connections between public taxpayer investment in pre-clinical scientific work and privatization into for-profit commercial ventures. We track how the scientific method influences clinical trials as well as the various degrees of protection and controls for research participants. The course shows the chemical and biological basis upon which drugs are regulated and licensed in Canada, and how they end up on provincial drug plans (or not). We explore the power of the pharmaceutical industry in the marketing of drugs and the manipulation of biological information, and how they shape the prescribing practices of doctors. The course concludes by exploring statistical elements of defining rare diseases and the access and availability challenges for drugs for rare diseases."

We begin by studying how gravity triggers fusion reactions in starts that create heat, light, and every element in our bodies except hydrogen: overall, stars shine by converting mass into energy (Einstein's E=mc^2). We discuss how we can use the corpses of stars (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes) to probe how space and time are related via Einstein's theories of relativity. We examine how stars are bound together into galaxies by gravity and how to use various wavelengths of light to determine why there are different types of galaxies: elegant spirals, massive ellipticals, and faint dwarf galaxies. We learn how the Doppler effect reveals that dark matter must produce some of the gravity that binds stars into galaxies, galaxies into clusters of galaxies, and clusters of galaxies into superclusters. We explore how we can use distant galaxies to study the development of the universe over its entire history, including the increasing importance of dark energy. We confront both the earliest instants and the far future of our universe's history: what we know, what we still hope to learn, and what we think we can ever learn. Finally, we join some modern scientists in the speculation about whether or not other universes might exist beyond the one we can perceive. Course credit exclusions: SC/NATS 1740 6.00.

    "description": "This course investigates performance anxiety through an examination of its causes and the application of coping strategies that are designed to limit or completely eliminate stage fright. Live performance is the culmination of an extended learning process and time period and the goal of this event, the replication of those skills so easily demonstrated in the studio, is often marred the debilitating effects of performance anxiety. The resulting performance results in an inaccurate assessment of the students learning and is a misrepresentation of their intended representation/interpretation of the music. Each student will investigate and define their level of anxiety from mild to severe, and through the identification of cognitive distortions will apply various strategies, physical and psychological, to overcome their performance anxiety. Open to non-majors."

    "description": "The course explores technical and philosophical approaches to creativity and its manifestations through interdisciplinary modes of artistic production. While creativity may be seen as a variable concept across different fields and context, we see commonalities in its description as a process that is shaped and developed through the sociocultural contexts in which it appears. Therefore, this course provides an experimental platform for social agency, developing ideas and creative solutions that can become catalysts for social justice and radical digital citizenship. To compare and contrast production methodologies, motivations and intersections across the arts, sciences and humanities, the course juxtaposes research presentations and experiential activities from broad academic, non-academic and epistemological contexts. This decoupling of practices with traditional mindsets provides a foundation for the student to explore new ideas and processes that deviate or build upon established examples. Students will read widely from key media theorists and creative practitioners, and experience films, sound works and performances. At the same time, they engage in practices of ideation through software and/or hardware prototyping, embracing the ethos of \"making\" as \"thinking in action\". Through this, the student's individual imagination and curiosity form supporting frameworks for exercising critical thinking and problem-solving in the contemporary arts. Classes consist of a blend of presentations on diverse art-technology histories, introductions to AMPD faculty and studios, experiential exercises centered on specific applications and environments, cursory portraits of practices through specific artists across a wide range of fields, and critiques of major projects that combine theoretical and pragmatic approaches. Open to non-majors."

Key feature of this approach is to blend multiple research strategies in the pursuit of output that cannot be predetermined. Grounded in cultural production, this approach has gained traction as a multi-disciplinary tool used by designers, academics, artist and scientists to address complex research questions through creativity & innovation. Students will be exposed to multiple approaches to research creation as a tool for academic exploration, while demonstrating a thorough grasp of the key concepts through the development & execution of course projects. The theoretical foundations of this course will be two-fold by providing a firm academic understanding of current research creation practices in academia and beyond. Through sourcing & investigation of scholarly articles & primary sources students will develop the ability to acutely frame research questions & develop applicable creative methodologies on which to base their research. Through a series of assignments and projects students are expected to develop an ability to evaluate the appropriateness of different approaches to artistic creation using well established ideas & techniques. As the course progresses, students will develop their own skills & techniques that will be applied in the execution of their own research creation project. This course will be a hybrid studio/seminar course where students are expected to develop skills as both researcher & artist. Weekly presentations by students and the course leader will build on the understanding of this approach, accumulating in final presentations of student projects. Visit to galleries, research laboratories, artist studios and presentation venues or other timely events will be incorporated into the course in order to augment student learning."

It provides an opportunity for established EAO members to refine their digital performance practice by introducing more advanced features, such as real-time processing of acoustic players, interactive systems based on sound analysis, hybrid analog/digital systems, and virtual acoustics. DATT, MUSI and PANF 3070/4070 sections all meet together in order to form the larger ensemble. The EAO engages in regular improvisation sessions as a means to further develop attentiveness to all aspects of sound including timbre, texture, blending noise/tone, and blending acoustic/electronic sources in space. Assignments focus on refining these more advanced digital instruments so that students can flexibly meet the demands of performing in this challenging ensemble context. Compositions drawn from the experimental and electroacoustic literature are performed, as are new pieces which draw on the EAO's unique gestural conducting language. The orchestra will present their work via public performances, in collaboration with the instructor and invited guest artists. Open to non-majors. Prerequisite: FA/MUSI 3070 3.00.

    "description": "This Experiential Education course is designed to engage students in creating three-dimensional, non-wearable sculpture in soft materials such as textiles, flexible foam and paper. Through a combination of presentations and hands-on studio projects, this course will explore soft materials as a sculptural medium, and contextualize the use of soft materials in both historical and contemporary frameworks of artistic production, emphasizing individual, process-based approaches to creative problem solving. The sculptural processes surrounding fabrication of soft sculptures introduces students to a range of sculptural methodologies and skills employing pattern drafting, assembly, and material manipulation. Through in-class demonstrations students are introduced to a range of skills and tools to be utilized in the production of their studio projects. Assignments consist of a series of projects exploring different working processes and sculptural methodologies. In addition to these projects, in-class discussions, technical assignments and readings engage students in the dialogue surrounding contemporary sculptural concerns such as form, process and spatial awareness. Craftsmanship and a demonstrated knowledge of materials are a major factor in this course. In order for students to be able to fully articulate their idea in a given material, they must understand the limits and possibilities inherent in the fabrication process. It is expected that each student will develop a degree of sophistication and competence when working with these material processes. Lectures, demonstrations, group critiques and hands-on instruction are the essential means by which we will investigate sculptural problem-solving. The class participates in material specific demonstrations, technical assignments and class critiques of finished work. Periodically there will be in-class work periods, but it is expected that the majority of the assignments will be completed outside of class time."

    "description": "This Experiential Education course is designed to engage students in creating three-dimensional, non-wearable sculpture in soft materials such as textiles, flexible foam and paper. Through a combination of presentations and hands-on studio projects, this course will explore soft materials as a sculptural medium, and contextualize the use of soft materials in both historical and contemporary frameworks of artistic production, emphasizing individual, process-based approaches to creative problem solving. The sculptural processes surrounding fabrication of soft sculptures introduces students to a range of sculptural methodologies and skills employing pattern drafting, assembly, and material manipulation. Through in-class demonstrations students are introduced to a range of skills and tools to be utilized in the production of their studio projects. Assignments consist of a series of projects exploring different working processes and sculptural methodologies. In addition to these projects, in-class discussions, technical assignments and readings engage students in the dialogue surrounding contemporary sculptural concerns such as form, process and spatial awareness. Craftsmanship and a demonstrated knowledge of materials are a major factor in this course. In order for students to be able to fully articulate their idea in a given material, they must understand the limits and possibilities inherent in the fabrication process. It is expected that each student will develop a degree of sophistication and competence when working with these material processes. Lectures, demonstrations, group critiques and hands-on instruction are the essential means by which we will investigate sculptural problem-solving. The class participates in material specific demonstrations, technical assignments and class critiques of finished work. Periodically there will be in-class work periods, but it is expected that the majority of the assignments will be completed outside of class time."

Students evolve individual plans for transitioning from undergraduate study to post graduate study or work by researching and analyzing the requirements and limitations of opportunities relevant to their current practice and future goals."
